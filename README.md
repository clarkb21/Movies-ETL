# Extract-Transform-Load Movies Analysis

## Purpose
- To prepare for a hackathon even, data was collected from Wikipedia and Kaggle resources, combined and cleaned, and loaded into a PostgreSQL database. 
- To complete this task, the ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) process was used to extract data using Pandas, clean the data and transform it into one dataframe, and then load it into a SQL database for long term storage.  

## Project Overview
- Using Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebook, I extracted data from multiple sources. 
- The raw data was analyzed, cleaned, and structured into the desired form using Pandas. 
- The clean data was then stored in a PostgreSQL database. 


### Challenge Overview
- There were multiple steps to transforming the data into the desired structure. 
- The data had several duplicate columns from the multiple sources. 
- The data also had several duplicate rows and null values that needed to be removed. 


## Resources
- Data Source: Wikipedia JSON file, Kaggle CSV file, Movie Ratings CSV file
- Software:  Python 3.7.6, Conda 4.13.0, Jupyter Notebook 6.4.8, Pandas 1.4.3, pgAdmin 4 Version 6.8, PostgreSQL Version 11.16
